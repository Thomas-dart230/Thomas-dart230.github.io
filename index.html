     <h1> Tom's Poem</h1>
    <h2> By <br> Thomas Rourke</h2>
    <p> This is the story of someone <strong>great </strong></p>
    <p> Someone who will meet their tragic <strong> fate </strong></p>
    <p> No one knows the exact <strong> date</strong></p>
    <p> This happened at the time of <strong> eight</strong></p>
    <p> There was a waiter named <strong> Tate</strong></p>
    <p> Who loved to carry more than his <strong> weight </strong></p>
    <p> He was always very agile and classy when carrying his <strong> plate</strong></p>
    <p>Untile he dropped his plate and receieved so much <strong> hate</strong></p>
    <p>This ruined his <strong> estate</strong></p>
    <p> the greatness of Tate and his waiting skills are still up for <br> <strong> debate</strong></p>
